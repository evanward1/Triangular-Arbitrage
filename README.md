Of course. Here is the Project Canvas in markdown format.

# **Project Canvas: Triangular Arbitrage Bot**

---

### **1. Problem**
* Finding profitable arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets is **computationally intensive** and time-consuming.
* Executing trades manually is too slow to capitalize on fleeting opportunities.
* Automated trading is risky and prone to errors from **insufficient funds**, or failing to meet exchange-specific rules like **minimum order size** and **minimum order value**.

---

### **2. Solution**
A command-line Python application that:
* **Scans** for profitable, multi-leg arbitrage opportunities on a given exchange.
* Provides an **"actionable" mode** (`--actionable`) to find trades that can be executed immediately with the user's available funds.
* Includes a comprehensive **wallet management** feature (`--wallet`) to display balances and public deposit addresses.
* Prompts for **interactive trade execution** with robust pre-flight checks to prevent common transaction failures.

---

### **3. Key Metrics**
* Number of profitable opportunities identified.
* Number of trades successfully executed.
* Net profit generated over time.
* Frequency of successful runs without execution errors.

---

### **4. Unique Value Proposition**
This tool doesn't just find theoretical opportunities; it provides **actionable, real-time trading suggestions** tailored to your wallet. The built-in pre-trade validation and interactive confirmation provide a crucial safety layer, making it a more intelligent and reliable tool than a simple scanner.

---

### **5. Unfair Advantage**
The combination of an efficient cycle detection algorithm (`networkx.find_negative_cycle`) with user-specific, actionable intelligence (`--actionable` mode) allows the bot to quickly filter out noise and present only the most relevant trading opportunities.

---

### **6. Channels**
* **Direct Use**: As a personal trading and market analysis tool.
* **Open Source**: Hosted on GitHub (`Drakkar-Software/Triangular-Arbitrage`) for community collaboration and use.

---

### **7. Target Users**
* Algorithmic traders looking for a reliable arbitrage detection engine.
* Manual crypto traders who want to automate the discovery phase of their strategy.
* Python developers interested in cryptocurrency trading and API integration.

---

### **8. Cost Structure**
* **Trading Fees**: Standard exchange fees are incurred on every executed trade.
* **Development Time**: The primary investment is the time spent building, testing, and refining the script's logic.

---

### **9. Revenue Streams**
* Currently a personal tool with no direct revenue model.
* Potential future monetization could involve offering it as a hosted service or developing more advanced, proprietary features.s
